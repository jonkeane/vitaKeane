	Abstract = {Using a new dataset of ASL fingerspelling, we have annotated variation in handshapes in order to quantify coarticulation between handshapes. We found variation of handshapes with increased ulnar digit flexion (AKA baby handshapes) in the handshapes for -C-, -D-, -E-, and -O-. We found that there is variation across speakers, across handshapes, and finally across surrounding environments. Flexed ulnar digits in handshapes surrounding -E- and -O- encourage increased ulnar digit flexion in the target -E- and -O-. We therefore demonstrate that both distinctive and allophonic features can trigger assimilation.},

@misc{Keane:2011ab,
	Abstract = {At 13 seconds per annotation, we have developed a system for coding {\textsc{asl}} fingerspelling that is not only quick and easy, and (most importantly) reproducible with very high agreement. Our method breaks coding into discrete tasks, each of which ought to be more reproducible than traditional transcription-style coding. Although used with fingerspelling, similar styles of coding could be adapted for many other types of linguistic data. These data can be used to address questions about the timing of fingerspelling, and with further feature annotations, the phonetics of fingerspelling and handshape generally.},

@misc{Keane:2011aa,
	Abstract = {In the course of a larger project working on fingerspelling recognition we compiled a database with over 3 hours of native signers fingerspelling a variety of words. This data was coded, and a reliable measure of duration was developed. We quantitatively confirmed several assumptions about fingerspelling (eg there is individual variation, and signers fingerspell slower non-English compared to English words). We also found that when fingerspelling longer words there is some evidence that signers chunk segments together into groups of 3-5 letters, which suggests a memory constraint, articulatory processing effect, or even perceiver oriented facilitation.},
